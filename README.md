## Fitness Tracker
An application which is able to view, create and track daily workouts. Check it out here: https://workout-tracker-master.herokuapp.com/

### Features
The user is able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. He is also able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the user can track the distance traveled. The application frontend has already been created, I created Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handled routes with Express.

### Tech/framework used
Built using Node.js framework, Mongo database and Express routes.
